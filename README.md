# rest2dns
Rest2DNS is DNS remote configuration server with simple REST API.

It is written in _ruby_ and uses _sinatra_ DSL for providing webservices.

With Rest2DNS you can simply add, update or delete zone from your DNS server remotely via HTTP protocol.

Currently _knot_ is the only supported DNS server software, bind is planned, others are up to you. Pull requests will be accepted.
